                        the miracle-working power of Jesus Christ, and with the presence of the Holy Spirit. At the Jericho House the goal is to address the whole person- spirit, soul and body.

                <p>The Jericho House is a Christ-Centered, 501©(3) Non-profit, drug and alcohol regeneration program located in Sautee-Nacoochee, Georgia. The Jericho House ministers healing and restoration to men caught in addictions using Biblical counseling,
                    teaching, small groups and work programs. Addiction is not a logical problem; it is a living problem. It is not a self-control problem; it is an inability to apply the Gospel to our hearts and an inability to accept God’s grace. It
                    is reaping what we have sown. It is the fruits of what we believe about others and ourselves. At The Jericho House, we understand that the contamination is not only physical, but also mental. Understanding this aids in the regeneration
                    of spirit, mind and body. The Jericho House ministers to the whole person. From detox to diploma, the whole family has the opportunity to heal and to learn to be whole and complete in Christ.</p>

                    <p class="testimony-text">"I've been on drugs since I was 12 and moved on to meth at 18. I am 22 now. God brought me here to heal me and my family. He brought me here to find myself and throw away my hollow mask. He's doing what He promised through Jericho House. Looking for God's direction for the future I am still not sure what this exactly looks like or where I should go when I leave. (I'm) just waiting for him to show up and show out and make His will for my life known."</p>
                    <h3 class="text-left">Zachary H.</h4>

                    <p class="testimony-text">"I had a rough childhood starting out, and I blocked out that pain completely. I started using at the age of 13. It was all fun and games until the age of 18 when a series of unfortunate events led to all the memories of my childhood surfacing all at the same time. I then spiraled down hill in a whirlpool of insanity. I got sober only to find myself right back where I started, getting high and losing everything, until finally God brought me to a place of brokenness and opened the doors to The Jericho House. In 7 short months, the Lord has completely changed my life. I can’t wait to see what He has in store for me as I walk this new path with Jesus Christ at my side."</p>
                    <h3 class="text-left">Brandon H.</h4>

                    <p class="testimony-text">"My name is Brandon. I was born in Greenville, OH, on December 9th, 1991. I grew up from a young age very close with my mom. I did not have much of a relationship with my biological father. I moved to Georgia with my mom and first step-dad when I was 6. I saw much physical abuse towards my mom for nearly 3 years before she and my step-dad divorced. A year and a half later, my mom remarried to Todd, who I call my dad today. Early on, I went through much abuse from him physically and mentally. As I got older, the relationship with he and I got better. I had grown up in church and was very involved in my youth group. At age 16, my drinking began and I would always drink alcoholically. Through high school, I struggled on and off with this. After graduating, I went to work for the Cobb County Fire Department. I also got engaged at this time. My abuse with my prescribed amphetamine medication for my ADHD began. My fiancé cheated on me and my addiction went from Adderall to meth use, costing me my career. After a year of sobriety between 2014 and 2015, I relapsed. This time my using led me to The Jericho House. In the 4 months I have been at The Jericho House, the things that God has already began to do and restore in my life is beyond words. I have stepped back into my walk with God, and I have been experiencing changes that I didn’t think were even possible."</p>
                     <h3 class="text-left">Josh</h4>

                     <p class="testimony-text">"I grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. I had a wonderful set of parents that did everything they possibly could for me. I did well in school and excelled in athletics. In high school, I was on my way to achieving my goals and dream when my life took a turn for the worst. I was 16 when I was involved in a tragic car accident, which took my best friend’s life. After this incident, I began a vicious cycle of self-loathing and condemnation. Soon I quit athletics and began using drugs. I slowly turned on everyone around me including my family. I even turned on God and rebelled so hard against Him that I had completely convinced myself that there was no God. Several years later, at the age of 23, I was arrested twice and charged with 4 felonies. At the time, I viewed it as a great nuisance and an inconvenience to my drug use. Now I look at it as an act of God, because over the last several months, and with great help from Larry McKenna and The Jericho House, I have begun to rebuild relationships with my family. I view myself and others in an extremely different light, and most of all, I have found hope in God, who is completely undeniable to me now. It definitely didn’t come easily, but I can tell you the transformation that has happened in my life has no doubt saved me, and wouldn’t have happened without this amazing ministry."</p>
                    
                     <h3 class="text-left">C.S.</h4>

                     <p class="testimony-text">"When I was 18 years old, I progressed to the obvious next step that everyone expects out of a suburban high school graduate: college. When I got there, I decided to forget my value system, and experiment with substances and sex. Two years later, I was in full-blown opiate addiction. I quit halfway through my senior year to attend a yearlong program. I completed this program in March 2015, went back to college, and graduated with my Bachelor’s Degree. Shortly after I got my first job, I tried using “just once” with a coworker of mine. This was the worst decision I could have made. At this point, I was trying to live life on my terms, getting caught up in my job and my girlfriend and the stresses of life, all the while not allowing God His rightful place in my life. I took Him off the throne and placed myself on it. I’ve always fooled myself into thinking I was a normal person, never wanting to admit that I really am an addict. Now that I’ve been able to admit that I am not normal, I can begin my growth and progression into living the life that God designed for me."</p>

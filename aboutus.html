                <p>The Jericho House was founded on September 2009 by Pastor Larry McKenna. A graduate of Dunklin Memorial Camp in Okeechobee, Florida, Pastor McKenna felt the call of the Lord to establish a safe haven for men seeking to escape the deadly
                    grips of addictions of all kinds. The Jericho House uses the same curriculum that has been saving lives at Dunklin Memorial Camp for over fifty years, and our ministry has been instrumental in helping to spread the Dunklin curriculum
                    all over the world.</p>

                <div class="blocktitle text-center">Our Vision</div>
                <p>The Lord has been steadily revealing the future of The Jericho House to Pastor McKenna and The Jericho House Board of Directors over the past few years. Our recent addition of a second campus in Dahlonega, Georgia, which is the new home
                    of Jericho Furnishings , is only the beginning of the vision. We are currently raising funds to build a state-of- the-art dormitory and meeting space for the men, as well as a cluster of family cabins, all on our 11-acre main campus
                    property in Sautee-Nacoochee, Georgia. In the years to come, we expect to be able to accommodate up to 40 men in the Regeneration Program. We greatly appreciate your donations to support our cause!</p>
